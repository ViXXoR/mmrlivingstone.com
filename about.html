			About Me
			</p>
			<p class="subtitle">
			I'm a software developer from Sudbury, Ontario. I was born and raised in this lovely city, 
			the existance of which has always revolved tightly around the large mining companies employing 
			citizens to work in the mines, or support companies that service them.
			</p>
			<p class="subtitle">
			While I have over 10 years of employment as a developer with an honours degree in Computer Science 
			from Laurentian University (with its campus in Sudbury), I have been writing code and experimenting with technology for nearly 20 years.
			<br/>
			My interest in technology, which would later evolve into an interest in software development, 
			began at an early age. I used to sit beside my (identical) twin brother in my fathers high drafting chair 
			and watch him play games like Command & Conquer: Red Alert, WarCraft II, or StarCraft, to name a few.
			I can remember watching his units moving around in their world, and wondering how it all worked.
			<br/>
			I also remember spending weekends playing the many Nintendo consoles (NES, SNES, N64, Gamecube) with my dad and brother. 
			If you're wondering, yes we also had a Sega Saturn, PlayStation, and PlayStation 2 growing up. 
			My dad owns all the Nintendo consoles (we don't count the Virtualboy), all the Sony consoles, a Sega Saturn, and an XBox One.
			<br/>
			I have written code in so many languages, I may have lost track. My attempt at a list (in order of them being used) would be:
			<br/>
			Turing, Starsiege: TRIBES scripts (TorqueScript), C++, PHP, Python, Java, Lua, JavaScript, C, Asterisk Dialplans, Bash, Ruby, C#, Objective-C, Go
			<br/><br/>
			I also have experience working with many different databases, including MySQL, MSSQL, and Oracle.
			</p>
			<p class="subtitle">
			I love learning, and refuse to be willfully ignorant about any topic, especially those involving software development.
			</p>
			<p class="subtitle">
			I have a lovely wife, who managed to get me to fall in love with her and propose in record time. I'm still not sure how she did it.<br/>
			We have a lovely baby boy, who was just born in 2018, and a Labradoodle named Hera, who can be quite a handful at times... but she's a good girl.
