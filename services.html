			Web Development

				<p class="subtitle">
				The area of web development is where I have done most of my work in the past several years.<br/><br/>

				On the backend, I am well-versed in the .NET WebAPI, as well as with PHP (I am currently enjoying working with the Phalcon framework) and Node.js.<br/><br/>
				I have worked with IIS, Apache, nginx, and the Azure platform.

			Code Review / Optimization / Refactoring
